# Apps SDK Examples Gallery

[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](LICENSE)

This repository showcases example UI components to be used with the Apps SDK, as well as example MCP servers that expose a collection of components as tools.
It is meant to be used as a starting point and source of inspiration to build your own apps for ChatGPT.

## MCP + Apps SDK overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open specification for connecting large language model clients to external tools, data, and user interfaces. An MCP server exposes tools that a model can call during a conversation and returns results according to the tool contracts. Those results can include extra metadata—such as inline HTML—that the Apps SDK uses to render rich UI components (widgets) alongside assistant messages.

Within the Apps SDK, MCP keeps the server, model, and UI in sync. By standardizing the wire format, authentication, and metadata, it lets ChatGPT reason about your connector the same way it reasons about built-in tools. A minimal MCP integration for Apps SDK implements three capabilities:

1. **List tools** – Your server advertises the tools it supports, including their JSON Schema input/output contracts and optional annotations (for example, `readOnlyHint`).
2. **Call tools** – When a model selects a tool, it issues a `call_tool` request with arguments that match the user intent. Your server executes the action and returns structured content the model can parse.
3. **Return widgets** – Alongside structured content, return embedded resources in the response metadata so the Apps SDK can render the interface inline in the Apps SDK client (ChatGPT).

Because the protocol is transport agnostic, you can host the server over Server-Sent Events or streaming HTTP—Apps SDK supports both.

The MCP servers in this demo highlight how each tool can light up widgets by combining structured payloads with `_meta.openai/outputTemplate` metadata returned from the MCP servers.

## Repository structure

- `src/` – Source for each widget example.
- `build/` – Generated HTML, JS, and CSS bundles after running the build step.
- `build-all.mts` – Vite build orchestrator that produces hashed bundles for every widget entrypoint.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm (recommended) or npm/yarn

## Install dependencies

Clone the repository and install the workspace dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

> Using npm or yarn? Install the root dependencies with your preferred client and adjust the commands below accordingly.

## Build the components gallery

The components are bundled into standalone assets that the MCP servers serve as reusable UI resources.

```bash
pnpm run build
```

This command runs `build-all.mts`, producing versioned `.html`, `.js`, and `.css` files inside `assets/`. Each widget is wrapped with the CSS it needs so you can host the bundles directly or ship them with your own server.


## Run the MCP servers

MCP server is deployed at URL: https://api.sirius-dev.com/mcp/{app_name}

Every tool response includes plain text content, structured JSON, and `_meta.openai/outputTemplate` metadata so the App can hydrate the matching widget.


## Testing in ChatGPT

To add these apps to ChatGPT, enable [developer mode](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/developer-mode), and add your apps in Settings > Connectors.


## Next steps

- Create your own components and add them to the gallery: drop new entries into `src/` and they will be picked up automatically by the build script.
- Expand business-logic on MCP server
